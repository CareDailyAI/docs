# Synthetic API: Behaviors

Behaviors provide **context** in each device to assist with automations and intelligence.

For example, a `Temperature and Humidity Sensor` may be used to detect a mold or mildew, or identify someone is taking a shower, or help ensure your refrigerator is operating properly. An `Entry Sensor` may be installed on an exit door on the perimeter of the home, or attached to a medicine cabinet. Each of these options are defined by the behaviors offered by bot microservices that add intelligence to the everyday operation of each device.

Historically, the server originally had a concept of "goals" and objectives for each device, allowing the mobile app to specify a `goalId` which would dictate the set of if-then rules that were automatically created for a device. You can see this [Legacy Goals API Documentation Here](https://iotapps.docs.apiary.io/#reference/creating-products/device-goals/get-device-goals-by-type) if you're interested.

As we moved beyond the server-driven rules engine and into the world of bots for automation, we maintained the same `goalId` value for device instances but mapped them to behaviors offered by bots. This allows the context of the device to remain with the device instance itself, and not be lost if a bot disappears.

It is possible for bot developers to add their own behaviors to a device type, which will in turn make those behaviors available through the mobile app through the `behaviors` state variable.

Advantages of Behaviors:
* Completely bot-driven
* Easily updatable based on the current capabilities of the bot without performing SQL operations on the database
* Localizable
* Easily brandable
* Organized inside a dictionary by device type

## **Input** : Update Device API

[Update a Device](https://iotapps.docs.apiary.io/#reference/devices/manage-single-device/update-a-device) and specify its `goalId` to declare the behavior ID you wish for this device to take on. 

Bots will be notified with a `device_metadata_updated(...)` event that cause the bot to treat this device differently when its behavior or context changes. It is up to the bots running inside this location to apply the behavior at runtime.

## Output

State Variable : `behaviors`

#### Properties

| Property    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Device Type | Each object is referenced by device type. When you add a new type of device, the bot will ensure behaviors are defined for it, and you can pull those behaviors out of the `behaviors` state variable based on the device type. |
| id          | This is the integer to inject into the device instance's `goalId` as the user applies this behavior to this device. See the Icon Font list in the README.md |
| icon_font   | The default font is from fontawesome.com 'regular' unless otherwise specified in an optional "icon_font" field |
| description | The text description of this behavior for this device. |
| name        | The title of this behavior |
| suggestions | Prioritized list of suggested names for each new device that selects this behavior. For example, when installing an Entry Sensor on an exit door, it is suggested that the first one be called 'Front Door', while the second Entry Sensor on an exit door be called 'Back/Side Door'. |
| weight      | Lower weights float to the top of the list. |
| spaces      | Prioritized list of multi-choice multi-select spaces to auto-select for each new sensor. For example, the first motion sensor should be installed in the Kitchen, so it is recommended that the app auto-select the 'Kitchen' space for this motion sensor. Note that a motion sensor can sometimes see multiple spaces, which is why that one is multi-choice multi-select. See the [Get Spaces API](https://iotapps.docs.apiary.io/#reference/locations/location-spaces/get-spaces) for a list of spaces to render in the app. |
| force_nickname | Optional. Default is False. If True, this tells the app to skip allowing the user to nickname the device and just force the next nickname in the list of suggestions. |
| subregions | List of compatible and recommended subregions for Vayyar Home behaviors. Defines a list of recommended subregions to create when a person selects this room for Vayyar Home. |

#### Subregion Object

The subregion object is added to the behaviors for Vayyar Home. As the behaviors for Vayyar Home specify the room to install in, the subregions recommend what subregions should be created if the user selects that room. 

After selecting a behavior, the user can be prompted to add a subregion. The subregion object describes the title and icon to show the user on the list of subregions to define, and links to a list of compatible subregion contexts to fulfill that subregion's objective.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| title | Title to suggest to the user to add a subregion, like "Add a bed" |
| icon | Suggested icon to show nearby the title when prompting a user to add a subregion, like "bed". |
| icon_font | Icon font package to use, usually 'far' (fontawesome.com regular). |
| context_id_list | List of compatible context ID's for Vayyar Home that would fulfill this subregion's objectives. See the [Vayyar Home Documentation](vayyar.md) `vayyar_subregion_behaviors` for more details.

If you're not certain about the reliability of the waterproof container, consider placing the Vibration Detect Sensor inside a re-sealable zipper platic bag and then into the waterproof container. Float the container in the upper water tank of the toilet. We find placing it near the handle area inside the tank works best, but you will need to experiment. If the floating container may interfere with the flap, consider attaching a string to the container and tying the other end of that string to something inside the tank to prevent the container from getting near the flap. When the toilet flushes, the drainage and movement of the water from the tank will be detected by the Touch Sensor and will register as a toilet flush.",

If you're not certain about the reliability of the waterproof container, consider placing the Vibration Detect Sensor inside a re-sealable zipper platic bag and then into the waterproof container. Float the container in the upper water tank of the toilet. We find placing it near the handle area inside the tank works best, but you will need to experiment. If the floating container may interfere with the flap, consider attaching a string to the container and tying the other end of that string to something inside the tank to prevent the container from getting near the flap. When the toilet flushes, the drainage and movement of the water from the tank will be detected by the Touch Sensor and will register as a toilet flush.",

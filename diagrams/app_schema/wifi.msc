# App Schema - Wi-Fi
# - Wi-Fi App Schema
# - The app may be opened directly to the Device Wi-Fi Configuration screen with a supported url schema.
# - This App Schema is used in coordination with 'device_onboarding/develco_dpxx' and 'device_configuration/develco_dpxx_wifi'.
# - This chart assumes the app is providing the url, but it may also be provided in an external application.
# - If the user is not logged in, then prompt them to log in first, and then continue processing the url.
